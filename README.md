## Introduction
This Github repository contains Rscripts to simulation COVID-19 outbreak in major Chinese cities: Wuhan, Chongqing, Beijing, and Shanghai. Below, we first introduce the functionality of each script, and present the model calibration. Lastly, we demonstrate how to run simulation to generate results.

## Model Calibration

## Results Generation

R scripts in the "simulation_by_policy" folders contains scripts that generats model outputs by running the functional scripts for the Wuhan model (wuhan_simulation_policy_by_age.R), and other-city model (other_city_simulation_policy_by_age.R) with speicified control policy instructions. For example, script "very_beta_E.R" generates the model outcome by varying range of beta_E from 0 to 0.5.
